My father is a carpenter by trade but was at the forefront of the CAD system development, so the first program that I wrote was to control a laser cutter. Since then I have had a great passion to try and find things to take apart, tinker with and perfect.",

A few years later and I am still **working** hands on, but now happily leading a team of developers, running modern web tech like react, typescript, and GraphQL as well as learning IOS and Android developement and C for hardware applications (and Finnish).
